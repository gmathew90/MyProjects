# MyProjects

Collection of all the projects that I have worked on



### 1) Mood Meter

(Python,Logistic Regression, SVM classifier)
- Trained a classifier that can detect the moods of tweets

- Used the classifier to track the mood of America for a whole week
 
- Concluded that mondays are the saddest and weekends are the happiest days of a week

### 2) BenchMarking
(C++)
- Developed programs to benchmark CPU,memory and disk
- Used the program to calculate the GFLOPS,IOPS,memory and disk speed of the local system
- Documented the comparison between memory and disk speeds, random and sequential read/write operations...

### 3) Sort Comparison
(AWS, Java, Python, Hadoop, Spark, Cloud Computing)
- Developed code to do sorting using External sorting, Hadoop and Spark
- Used AWS instances to sort 10 GB using External Sorting, Hadoop and Spark
- Built Clusters using AWS instances to sort 100 GB of data using Hadoop and Spark
- Compared the speed of External sorting, Hadoop and Spark

### 4)CloudKon
(AWS, SQS, DynamoDB, python)
- Implemented cloudKon architecture to create a 16 node distributed task execution system 
http://www.cs.iit.edu/~iraicu/teaching/CS554-F13/lecture03_CloudKon-overview.pdf
- Used this architecture to create a system that can combine pictures into a video
- Conducted experiments to verify the scalability of cloudKon Distributed system
