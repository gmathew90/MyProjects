@TopSzn_6 @tylerkilcrease What time?<endofTweet>
I'm pretty sure Sammy Watkins rolled out of bounds untouched but that's just me<endofTweet>
The Bills can't even cross the 50 in a two minute drill. That offense is horrendous.<endofTweet>
So if you fall out of bounds you are inbounds??<endofTweet>
@OldManWinter14 It was an outstanding episode! Congrats to you all and thanks for this amazing episode. Can't wait to rewatch.<endofTweet>
