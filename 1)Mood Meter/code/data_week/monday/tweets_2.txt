You know who you are even though you won't see this, fuck you.  https://t.co/nmvfcYuN7l<endofTweet>

Not really sure how he wasn't out of bounds there. Not really sure why Tyrod was in the game. Not really sure why I subject myself to #Bills<endofTweet>
my back killing me. but atleast my feet don't hurt🙌🏿<endofTweet>
Well, Gronk sucked on my fantasy team this week. I guess he's allowed a bad one.<endofTweet>
The officiating tonight was atrocious<endofTweet>
When he can't stay away is when uk it's real 😩😂<endofTweet>

Called em out for tonight and the season lol. It's been so bad dude.<endofTweet>
Why did the ref call the wr down on that last play? He rolled out with 2 seconds left clearly<endofTweet>
Apparently watkins was touched before going out of bounds<endofTweet>
I stay sending the wrong messages to the wrong people 😂<endofTweet>
Wtf was I suppose to do ?????<endofTweet>
I JUST RIPPED ANOTHER PAIR OF PANTS WUT<endofTweet>
The announcers summed it up in the end "What a screwed up night"<endofTweet>
What happened to Gruden?<endofTweet>
The refs blew the game and the carpenter field goal off the upright didn't help<endofTweet>

Why the FUCK is this even a question? https://t.co/7uNtUwPjz2<endofTweet>
lol but he went out of bounds. You can clearly see he went out of bounds. They had 2 seconds. What a piece of ridiculousness. #BUFvsNE<endofTweet>
